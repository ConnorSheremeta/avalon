    manager: |
      Managers have overall accountability for the collection. Managers can 
      create collections and assign editor and depositor roles for those 
      collections. They set the default access controls for items added to 
      the collection, and they also step in when a published item needs 
      revising or deleting. Managers can also do anything an editor or 
      depositor can do.
      <br/><br/>
      <i><b>NOTE:</b> To assign someone the Manager 
      role, you must first ask your administrator to add that user to the 
      Manager group.</i>
    editor: |
      Editors have supervisory responsibility for the collection building â€” the 
      ingest and description process. They can assign depositor roles, change 
      the name or description of the collection, and can modify the access 
      controls for individual items in the collection. Editors can also do 
      anything a depositor can do.
    depositor: |
      Depositors add media to the collection and describe it with metadata. 
      They can publish items but not unpublish. They can only modify or 
      delete unpublished items.
